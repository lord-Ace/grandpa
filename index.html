                    <h2>About Joseph Azu</h2>
                    <p>
                        Joseph Ikemefune Azu, fondly known as JoeJoe, was born
                        on October 20, 1948, in Jos, Plateau State. A passionate
                        learner, he pursued education in computer programming
                        and business administration, earning multiple
                        certifications and a B.Sc. from the University of Lagos.
                        He built a distinguished career in Nigeria’s tech
                        industry, working with top firms like NCR, ICL, and MBM.
                        Joe was a devout Catholic, a loving husband to Veronica,
                        and a proud father and grandfather. He was deeply
                        involved in community and social groups, known for his
                        joyful spirit, integrity, and commitment to truth. His
                        legacy lives on through his family, faith, and the many
                        lives he touched.
